## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```html
      <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io">
        <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR code to Frontend Mentor">
      </a>

The QR code in this project functions as a clickable link and is accessible to screen readers.
```
```css
body {
    background-color: #d5e1ef;
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
}

Realized that full-page centering required styling the body element (not just main) as a full-height flex container
```

### Continued development

Sharpen my layout and semantic HTML skills ðŸ§±

Practice reading Figma specs ðŸŽ¨

Improve my CSS fluency ðŸŽ¯

### Useful resources
